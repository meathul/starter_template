Perfect — here’s a fully **generalized, production-ready `README.md`** for a CrewAI starter template. No specific examples, just placeholders and instructions on *where* to customize.

# 🤖 CrewAI Starter Template

A general-purpose template for building multi-agent systems using [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com). This template is modular and scalable — perfect for rapid prototyping or production deployments.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meathul/starter_template.git
cd starter_template
````

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Configuration Guide

### 🧠 Agents (`agents/agent_setup.py`)

Define all agents with their roles, goals, and tools in this file.

* Placeholder for initializing each agent
* Agents can use one or more tools (see `tools/`)
* Use `verbose=True` for debug logging (optional)

---

### 🛠 Tools (`tools/`)

Each tool should be its own file, named descriptively.

* Tools should expose a callable class or function
* Tools are injected into agents at creation
* Custom logic or third-party APIs can be used here

---

### 📋 Tasks (`tasks/task_setup.py`)

Define tasks with:

* A description
* Expected output
* Assigned agent

Each task should align with a specific agent's responsibilities.

---

### 🧑‍💼 Crew Setup (`crew/crew_setup.py`)

Assemble all agents and tasks into a CrewAI crew.

* Import agents and tasks
* Pass them to the `Crew()` object
* Optional parameters: `verbose`, `memory`, `process`

---

### 🚀 Main Entry Point (`main.py`)

Run the crew from here.

```python
from crew.crew_setup import crew

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = crew.kickoff()
    print(result)
```

---

## 📦 Requirements

Typical dependencies (in `requirements.txt`):

```
crewai
openai
langchain
python-dotenv
```

Add additional libraries as your project expands.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Use a `.env` file to store API keys securely.
* You can extend this template to include memory, logging, streaming output, etc.
* To avoid import issues, always run from the project root.

Let me know if you want me to auto-generate all the matching placeholder `.py` files (`agent_setup.py`, `tool_name.py`, etc.) with blank class/function structures inside — I can provide the entire starter project as code too.
